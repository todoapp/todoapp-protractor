# todoapp-protractor
Protractor tests for Todo App.

To run the tests you will need to start the Selenium Server:

    webdriver-manager start

Before you run the tests on your local you may need to change the port number
so that it matches with the port IIS Express is running and then type:

    protractor conf.js
